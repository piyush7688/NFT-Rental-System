# NFT Rental System

## Project Description

The NFT Rental System is a blockchain-based smart contract built on the Stacks network using Clarity language. This innovative system enables temporary NFT usage rights, allowing NFT owners to rent out their digital assets for specified durations while maintaining ownership. The system automatically handles rental periods and returns, creating a seamless marketplace for NFT utility without permanent ownership transfer.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the NFT ecosystem by creating a sustainable rental economy that maximizes the utility of digital assets. We aim to:

- **Democratize Access**: Make expensive NFTs accessible to users who can't afford to purchase them outright
- **Generate Passive Income**: Enable NFT owners to monetize their collections through rental income
- **Increase NFT Utility**: Transform static digital assets into dynamic, revenue-generating resources
- **Build Trust**: Provide a secure, automated system that protects both renters and owners
- **Foster Innovation**: Create new business models and use cases for NFT technology
